            <h1>WELCOME TO THE GRIN</h1>
            <p style="margin: 50px;">"I've always wanted a place where I could call home. Somewhere that would always be there, no matter what happened in the world. A tavern if you will. Where I could let my fellow adventurers rest their heads from the chaos while creating some of my own. 
                To build kinship, a brotherhood with those who felt just a little out of place, lost but with a smile on their faces.
                Difficult task, especially when you feel lost yourself. To create an empire ruled not by one, but many. Perhaps "Nine" even…
                For a Kingdom falls when the King is blind to what's built around him."
                With humble beginnings, The Blacktooth Grin Guild was formed.
            </p>
            <p>A decade of existence inside our World of Warcraft.
                Ten years ago, on January 7th, 2013 our declaration of existence was signed. Our ranks swelled with the lost, the misfits, and the drunk. The faces of legends are still present today, and others… faded away, frozen in time, never forgotten.                 
                The foundation of our home was built and our legacy began.  Our band of mercenaries fought with 
                heart and brawn to defeat foes such as "Guerrilla Warfare" and "The Alliance Vanguard." Strengthening our bonds and our shitposting. Solidifying that the Blacktooth Grin was here to stay. From the dark times of unpopular expansions to the golden ages, we were here.                
                Witnessing the great "Server Exodus" to places such as Emerald Dream to the Shard of Sadness: The end of World PvP. The Grin survived.                
                To the construction and birth of the Grin Warband: The Sin-Eaters our most fierce pixel-slaying warriors, born to defeat raid bosses such as Ursoc, Kil'jaden, and Argus the Unmaker,  the corrupted world soul itself! Once again proving that the Blacktooth Grin could evolve once more to continue its journey, to where we are today.
                10 years later, friendships are built, and the legacy continues…             
                Though the faces grow older and the goals may have changed, one thing remains constant,                
                The Blacktooth Grin will always be our home, one that I, will continue to fight for. No matter what comes our way to ensure that little tavern continues to be a home for the lost, with a smile on their face.</p>
