            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"> I'm the "Big Grin" himself, The Guild Master and founder of the Blacktooth Grin Guild. The Rogue One trick, better known in my little world as Sam the Rogue. I've been playing World of Warcraft for a few years over a decade starting in 2010 as a "Wrath Baby" As a real rags-to-riches story. Some would call me an avid player of World of Warcraft as I've amassed a whopping 1330+ days played on my rogue. I've dabbled in things from Arena Duelist to our AOTC raid experience, the 1% club in M+, All the way down to being an all-out sweaty when it comes to in-game lore. I'd like to think I've done it all, seen it all, and I definitely wish I was better at it all. One thing is for sure, I couldn't be happier spending the last decade here on our very own "Island of Misfits and Broken Toys" with all our hooligans and degenerates at the Grin.
                As a dead president once said, "Four more years!" Nah, scratch that, Make it ten. Blacktooth Grin! It's time to show 'em your teeth.

                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">I'm Sevenhundred, raid leader of The Blacktooth Grin. I've played World of Warcraft off and on since 2006, and joined the guild during 9.1 (Sanctum of Domination) progression. I am the man to see about anything raid related, unless it's something I can push off on someone else. I am willing to fill any role that the raid may need, but you'll usually see me playing my shadow priest. Outside of raid, I am probably collecting mounts or doing pointless grinds, and occasionally someone will rope me in on a few M+ dungeons. I hope to continue to promote a fun and friendly raid environment where we can laugh at wiping on trash every week or someone falling in a hole, while maintaining our consistent AOTC status.

            <p id="tim">Tim, Timothy, Timmifer, Mike, Dad, Your Goddamn Pets Are In The Way; I answer to all of 'em.
                I've been a gamer since 1983, starting with an Atari 2600 in the shag carpeted basement of my parent's house.                
                My MMO journey started with Sanctuary, a text based MUD that we played by abusing the open door policy of the local college's computer labs.                
                In November of 2004, I received WoW as an early Christmas present from my Wife.  After a couple weeks of watching me kill boars and owls and those pesky Defias, we were upgrading a 2nd PC, and began adventuring in Azeroth together.  We found a guild that was dipping its toe into raiding, with Zul'Gurub, and were hooked by Endgame content.                
                Years and Expansions rolled by with different levels of commitment and involvement through each, we found our way back deep into the fold with Shadowlands, and began really raiding again.                
                Almost 2 decades after we started, while recruiting for a floundering guild that we were running, we found Sam, and received a trial invitation to the Blacktooth Grin.  Hopped up on pain meds, and surrounded by strangers, it became clear very quickly that these hooligans were just friends we hadn't met yet.                
                I'm thrilled with being a part of this melting pot of mayhem, and can't wait for the adventures to come. And when all else fails, Blame the Hunter.

            <p style="font-size: 1.2em;"> I'm Grunk, former GM and current officer of the Blacktooth Grin. I'm the only person who started playing WoW at the end of WoD and kept playing. I'm typically in a healing or tank role, as I'm mostly incapable of DPSing (or being patient enough to sit in DPS queues). Outside of WoW, I play a lot of RPGs, including TTRPGs, am an avid lifter, and have a rescue dog, Rush.

                <p style="font-size: 1.2em;">Huh? Oh… sorry I was napping. Sup I’m Rune. I’ve been playing WoW since WOTLK. I joined the guild back in Shadowlands Season 2 during Sanctum of Domination prog as DPS. I became officer in Season 3 Shadowlands as raid leader for Sepulcher of the First Ones. I have horrible ADHD and can play most classes effectively but my main will always be my DK. (He just tends to take vacations. Cries in DK) I enjoy progression, doing keys, and creating memes, and memories. I love keeping morale high with comic relief during stressful progression and just hanging out with guildies. I remained an officer after I stepped down from raid lead because my memes and soundboard are OP but mostly because I’m a living meme. I also play a ton of other games. I’m big into survival crafting, factory building, and RPGs. My goal has always been to keep the fun times going while falling into as many holes as possible.
